## Favorite CPSC120L Labs

### Lab 5
> Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite of mine this course because I found many of 
the works we did that required user input to be fun. I found this one the most fun 
because it had many parts to it. I found it enjoyable how this lab also allowed to
combine a lot of what we had learned such as if else statements, writing functions, 
using static cast and working in seperate tabs for our main code and the functions.
### Lab 6
> Lab 6, both parts was another one of my favorites. I enjoyed working with my 
partner on this one because it was fun to make the sandwhich code. Part two which
had us code the blackjack game was one of my favorites because it allowed me to
struggle a bit. I took a lot of time debugging this project and going through 
many testing trials. Getting to struggle on this code allowed to build a deeper
understanding on the concepts we had been going over.
### Lab 8
> Lab 8, part 2 was another one of my favorites because it dealt with having to make 
a pattern. I thought it was interesting having to figure out a way to replicate the 
pattern and to really think about how to go about it. It was intesting knowing loops 
could be nested inside another loop and how we were able to replicate the pattern in 
this matter.
