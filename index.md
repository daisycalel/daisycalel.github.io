## Favorite CPSC120L Labs

### Lab 5
> Lab 5
### Lab 6
> Lab 6, both parts was another one of my favorites. I enjoyed working with my 
partner on this one because it was fun to make the sandwhich code. Part two which
had us code the blackjack game was one of my favorites because it allowed me to
struggle a bit. I took a lot of time debugging this project and going through 
many testing trials.
### Lab 8
> Lab 8, part 2 was another one of my favorites because it dealt with having to make a pattern.
I thought it was interesting having to figure out a way to replicate the pattern and
to really think about how to go about it. It was intesting knowing loops could be nested
inside another loop and how we were able to replicate the pattern in this matter.
